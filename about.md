The Type@Cooper Extended certificate in typeface design puts students through a year-long course of study, exploring the foundations of typography in hands-on classes, while developing a broad understanding of the field through lectures, discussions, and research. Each member of the class of 2018 used the knowledge and skills they gained to develop a family of original text typefaces over eight months. This site is a showcase of their work.

Hannes Famira and Alexander Tochilovsky provided primary instruction, with support from teaching assistants Tida Tep, Flavia Zimbardi, and Spencer Charles.
