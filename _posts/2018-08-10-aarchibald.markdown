  Aarchibald is a typeface family designed for architectural publications and German language. Aarchibald is an open, readable typeface with sharp, angular elements. Extra-low cap height and short extenders allow for tight line spacing and make it easy to use in cap-heavy setups. Supports most European languages and includes Cyrillic alphabet, linear and old-style number sets, ligatures and open type features.
